        <!-- Overview of the guide and its purpose -->
        <p>
          Welcome to the Daisy Studios Designers Guide. This information is your
          go-to reference for all things design across the Daisy Studios
          website. You'll find standards and guidance here for color usage,
          typography choices, spacing systems, grid layouts, and media
          formatting. <br /><br />
          The goal is to keep everything consistent, intentional, and aligned
          with the Daisy Studios visual identity — helping designers,
          developers, and collaborators build a cohesive and elegant user
          experience.

        <p>
          The typography used across the Daisy Studios website is designed for
          clarity, personality, and visual hierarchy. We use Mona Sans and Mona
          Sans Expanded to create strong, consistent layouts that reflect our
          brand identity.

      <!--SPACING AND GRIDS SECTION-->
      <section id="grids">
        <h2>Spacing & Grids</h2>
        <!-- Description of why spacing and layout matter -->
        <p>
          Consistent spacing and structure are essential to maintaining a clean,
          readable, and well-balanced layout across the Daisy Studios website.
          This system ensures design clarity and visual harmony, no matter the
          content or screen size.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The website follows a <strong>12-column grid layout</strong> as the
          foundation for all sections and components. Designers and developers
          should align all elements to this grid to maintain alignment and
          modularity throughout the site.
        </p>

        <!-- Explanation of grid and spacing standards -->
        <p>
          All page margins are set to <strong>40px</strong> on both sides. This
          margin ensures that content has breathing room and does not touch the
          edges of the screen, especially on smaller devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create clear separation and rhythm between sections, a vertical
          break of <strong>280px</strong> should be maintained. This spacing
          helps visually distinguish content blocks and allows for a smoother
          reading experience.

      <!--MEDIA FORMATTING SECTION-->
      <section id="media">
        <h2>Media Formatting</h2>
        <!-- Intro about consistent media formatting -->
        <p>
          All media assets on the Daisy Studios website including images and
          videos follow a consistent formatting system to maintain visual
          harmony and scalability across all screen sizes.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- Details about formatting rules -->
        <!-- The <strong> code section works as a highlighter to make the important parts of the bext bolder and highlighted in yellow -->
        <p>
          Every media file is formatted using a
          <strong>16:9 aspect ratio</strong>, ensuring that visuals display
          predictably and cleanly in both desktop and mobile environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are <strong>four standardized media sizes</strong> used
          throughout the site, ranging from large hero visuals to small content
          blocks.
        </p>

        <p>
          By adhering to these formatting rules, Daisy Studios ensures media is
          both brand-consistent and highly adaptable across all platforms and
          devices.
